# Goroutines From Beginning to Advanced

This repository documents my journey of learning and applying goroutines and channels in Go, from basic to advanced, culminating in a real project.

My goal with this repository is to solidify my understanding of Go's concurrency model and showcase my progress to potential recruiters, especially for opportunities abroad.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections, each containing exercises and micro-projects that build upon the previous level of knowledge:

-   **[Beginner](Beginner/)**: Foundational concepts of goroutines, channels, and basic synchronization.
-   **[Intermediate](Intermediate/)**: Common concurrency patterns, more elaborate problems, and introduction to benchmarking.
-   **[Advanced](Advanced/)**: Complex scenarios, optimization techniques, and advanced synchronization primitives.
-   **[RealProject](RealProject/)**: A practical application integrating various concurrency concepts learned throughout the journey.

## Technologies Used

-   Go Programming Language

## How to Run the Examples

Each exercise or project within its respective folder will contain its own `main.go` file. To run any example:

1.  Navigate to the specific exercise directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd Beginner/Exercise01
    ```
2.  Run the Go program:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
3.  (Optional) To run tests if available:
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```
4.  (Optional) To run benchmarks if available:
    ```bash
    go test -bench=. ./...
    ```
